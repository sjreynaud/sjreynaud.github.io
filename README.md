## About This Portfolio Template

This portfolio is designed to demonstrate skills in:
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Data modeling and analysis
- Creating interactive, professional dashboards
- Transforming complex data into actionable insights

## 🚀 Projects


### 🎯 Predictive Analytics: Breast Cancer Survival
*🎯 Predictive Analytics: Breast Cancer Survival — This project applied machine learning to forecast 5-year survival outcomes for breast cancer patients using clinical and demographic data. Leveraging Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost), SHAP for interpretability, and Tableau for stakeholder-facing visuals, the analysis revealed tumor stage, lymph node involvement, and hormone receptor status as top predictors. XGBoost achieved the highest ROC-AUC (0.91), and SHAP plots clarified how age and tumor size influenced survival probabilities. The final dashboard synthesized model insights into an intuitive format for clinicians, supporting risk stratification and shared decision-making.*

### 🔬 FSGS Kidney Disease Analytics
*🔬 FSGS Kidney Disease Analytics (Research Phase Ongoing) — This research initiative explores predictive modeling for Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), aiming to identify clinical markers linked to disease progression and renal outcomes. Using Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas) and SHAP for interpretability, the project investigates variables such as proteinuria levels, eGFR decline, and APOL1 genotype. Early findings suggest collapsing variants and biopsy patterns may significantly influence prognosis. Visual tools like Tableau and Power BI are being used to prototype stakeholder-facing dashboards, with iterative design focused on clinical relevance and transparent risk communication.*

### 🧬 Prostate Cancer Survival Modeling
*🧠 Prostate Cancer Survival Modeling (Research Phase Ongoing) — This ongoing research project applies machine learning to predict long-term survival outcomes in prostate cancer patients, focusing on clinical staging, PSA levels, Gleason scores, and treatment modalities. Using Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost) and SHAP for model interpretability, the analysis aims to uncover nuanced survival patterns across risk groups. Preliminary results suggest that Gleason grade and PSA velocity are strong predictors of recurrence and mortality. Visual dashboards built in Tableau and Power BI are being iteratively designed to support urologists and oncologists in personalized treatment planning and risk communication.*

### 🧬 Colon Cancer Survival Analytics
*🧬 Colon Cancer Survival Analytics (Research Phase Ongoing) — This project investigates predictive modeling for long-term survival in colon cancer patients, focusing on clinical staging, lymph node involvement, tumor grade, and treatment pathways. Using Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost) and SHAP for interpretability, the research aims to uncover survival disparities across demographic and molecular subgroups. Early insights suggest that microsatellite instability status and lymph node ratio are strong predictors of recurrence and mortality. Tableau and Power BI are being used to prototype stakeholder-facing dashboards, with iterative design centered on clinical relevance, transparency, and personalized risk communication.*

## 💡 How to Use This Template

Creating your own portfolio from this template is a simple, four-step process.

### 1. Create a New Repository from this Template
Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this repository page, then select **"Create a new repository"**.

### 2. Name Your Repository for GitHub Pages
This is the most important step. To turn your portfolio into a live website, you **must** name your new repository in the following format:
`your-username.github.io`
*(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.)*

### 3. Customize Your Portfolio
Open the `index.html` file and begin personalizing it. The file contains helpful `<!--💡UPDATE: ... -->` comments to guide you on where to change:
- Your name and title
- Social media links
- The "About Me" section
- Your project titles, descriptions, and links
- Your list of skills

### 4. Add Your Files
- Upload your profile photo and project preview images to the `assets/images/` folder.
- Upload your CV (e.g., in PDF format) to the `assets/` folder.
- Create your favicon and add it to the root folder.

Once you commit your changes, your new portfolio website will be live at `https://your-username.github.io` within a few minutes!
