# Project Overview

This study investigates survival outcomes in patients diagnosed with FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis) Kidney Disease. Using a cleaned clinical dataset, we apply survival analysis techniques to identify risk factors and stratify patients based on predicted outcomes.

The pipeline includes:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Cox proportional hazards modeling
- Kaplan-Meier survival curve visualization
- Risk stratification and evaluation

All results are documented and visualized for clinical reporting and publication.
