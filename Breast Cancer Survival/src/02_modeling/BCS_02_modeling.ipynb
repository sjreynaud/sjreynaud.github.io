Using cph.baseline_survival_.plot(), the curve illustrates how the likelihood of survival declines across months, starting at 1.0 and tapering toward zero. The plot is customized with axis labels, a title, and a grid for clarity, then saved to the output directory as a PNG file. This visualization is crucial for understanding the temporal dynamics of survival in the absence of covariate effects."
