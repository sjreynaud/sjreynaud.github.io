After mounting Google Drive with drive.mount('/content/drive'), the dataset is read into a pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv(...). The code then performs a quick diagnostic using df.shape to reveal the dataset’s dimensions (2509 rows × 34 columns), df.head() to preview the first few patient records, and df.info() to assess column types and missing values. These steps are foundational for understanding the dataset’s structure, verifying patient-level granularity, and confirming the presence of key clinical variables such as “Patient ID,” “Age at Diagnosis,” and “Type of Breast Surgery.” This inspection ensures readiness for downstream tasks like deduplication, imputation, and survival modeling, while anchoring the workflow in reproducibility and clinical relevance."

It also suggests imputing categorical values with the mode or a placeholder like \"Unknown,\" and continuous values with the median or clinically informed estimates. The final line of code standardizes and numerically encodes the 'ER Status' column by converting its string values to uppercase and mapping 'POSITIVE' to 1 and 'NEGATIVE' to 0.

This technique is known as mean imputation and is widely used to preserve the statistical properties of the dataset while handling missing data. By applying the fillna() method with df[numeric_cols].mean() as the argument, the code ensures that each numeric column is filled with its own mean value, maintaining column-wise integrity and preventing the introduction of bias that could occur if a single global value were used. This step is crucial before feeding the data into machine learning models, which typically cannot handle missing values directly."

        "**Step#7**  This code shown verifies that all missing values in a pandas DataFrame have been successfully handled, which is a critical final step in clinical data cleaning workflows. By executing print(df.isnull().sum()), the code outputs the count of null (NaN) values for each column in the DataFrame df. Seeing zeros across all columns confirms that previous imputation steps—such as filling numeric columns with their mean and categorical columns with their mode—were effective. This validation ensures the dataset is complete and ready for downstream tasks like statistical analysis, survival modeling, or machine learning. Using Colab for this process offers a reproducible, cloud-based environment ideal for collaborative clinical research and streamlined data preparation."

The command df.to_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/METABRIC_cleaned_imputed.csv', index=False) writes the contents of the DataFrame df to a CSV file named \"METABRIC_cleaned_imputed.csv\" in the specified Drive folder, omitting the index column to keep the file tidy. This step is especially useful in clinical data workflows where reproducibility and traceability are critical, allowing collaborators to access the processed dataset without rerunning the entire pipeline. Colab’s integration with Google Drive makes it easy to manage and persist data artifacts directly from your notebook environment."
