        "# Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "## Study design\n",
        "This is a retrospective, observational analysis of the METABRIC dataset focusing on overall survival. The workflow emphasizes reproducibility, clear preprocessing, transparent modeling choices, and interpretable reporting for clinical stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data preprocessing\n",
        "- **Data loading:** Read METABRIC_cleaned_imputed.csv with explicit dtypes; validate schema\n",
        "- **Train/test split:** Stratified on event indicator when appropriate; temporal leakage minimized by using baseline covariates only\n",
        "- **Variable handling:**\n",
        "  - **Numeric:** Standardized (z-score) after train/test split to prevent leakage\n",
        "  - **Categorical:** One-hot encoding with explicit feature name construction for traceability\n",
        "  - **Dates/times:** Survival time in months; event indicator binary\n",
        "- **Imputation:** Already performed in source file; residual missingness checked and documented in outputs/data_quality/missingness.md\n",
        "- **Feature registry:** A YAML/JSON registry maps original variables to engineered features for interpretability\n",
        "\n",
        "## Clinical variables of interest\n",
        "- **Demographics:** Age at diagnosis\n",
        "- **Tumor characteristics:** Size, grade, nodal status, ER/PR/HER2, molecular subtype\n",
        "- **Treatment proxies:** Surgery, chemo, endocrine where available\n",
        "- **Genomic features:** Included if present; handled with dimensionality reduction only if clinically justified\n",
        "\n",
        "## Outcomes\n",
        "- **Primary outcome:** Overall survival\n",
        "- **Definition:** Time-to-event (months) with event indicator; censoring respected\n",
        "\n",
        "## Statistical analysis\n",
        "- **Univariate survival:** Kaplan–Meier curves; log-rank tests for categorical strata\n",
        "- **Multivariable survival models:**\n",
        "  - **Cox proportional hazards (Cox PH):** Baseline model for interpretability\n",
        "    - Hazard:\n",

        "      \n",
        "    - **Assumptions:** Proportional hazards tested via Schoenfeld residuals\n",
        "    - **Reporting:** Coefficients, hazard ratios (HR), 95% CIs, p-values\n",
        "  - **Random survival forests (RSF):** Nonlinear model for robustness\n",
        "    - **Reporting:** Variable importance; risk stratification\n",
        "- **Model validation:**\n",
        "  - **Internal validation:** 5-fold cross-validation (time-respecting folds as feasible)\n",
        "  - **Metrics:** Concordance index (C-index), integrated Brier score (IBS), time-dependent AUC\n",
        "- **Calibration and interpretability:**\n",
        "  - **Calibration:** Risk deciles vs. observed outcomes; calibration plots\n",
        "  - **Interpretability:** Coefficients (Cox), partial dependence for RSF; SHAP adapted to survival risks where methodologically suitable\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assumption checks\n",
        "- **Proportional hazards:** Schoenfeld residual tests; time-varying effects considered if violations observed\n",
        "- **Influential observations:** DFBETA-like diagnostics; sensitivity analyses with/without outliers\n",
        "- **Missingness impact:** Imputation strategy reviewed; sensitivity to alternative imputations documented\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reproducibility\n",
        "- **Environment:** Pinned versions in requirements.txt and Colab cell prints\n",
        "- **Run metadata:** Each output includes dataset hash, git commit, timestamp, and code cell ID\n",
        "- **Outputs:** Figures/tables saved with deterministic filenames linking to notebook cells\n",
        "\n",
        "## Limitations\n",
        "- **Observational data:** Confounding and selection bias possible\n",
        "- **Measurement error:** Clinical variables may be heterogeneously measured\n",
        "- **Generalizability:** Findings reflect METABRIC cohort; external validation needed\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reporting standards\n",
        "- **Clinical:** Transparent presentation of HRs, CIs, and clinically meaningful stratifications\n",
        "- **Statistical:** Clearly state assumptions, validation strategy, and caveats\n",
        "- **Reproducible artifacts:** All plots/tables traced to code and parameters in outputs/\n"
