        "# Project overview\n",
        "\n",
        "## Context and objectives\n",
        "This repository supports a clinical data science workflow using the METABRIC_cleaned_imputed.csv dataset to explore prognostic factors in breast cancer and build interpretable survival models. The aim is to produce reproducible analyses, transparent methodology, and publication-ready figures/tables for collaboration.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Clinical questions\n",
        "- **Primary:** Which clinicopathologic features are associated with overall survival in METABRIC?\n",
        "- **Secondary:** How do model-based risk scores compare to traditional staging (e.g., tumor size, nodal status), and can we present interpretable feature effects?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset summary\n",
        "- **Source:** METABRIC (cleaned + imputed version used here)\n",
        "- **Rows/columns:** See data profile in outputs/data_profile/summary.md\n",
        "- **Key variables:** Overall survival time (months), event indicator, age at diagnosis, tumor size, nodal status, grade, ER/PR/HER2 status, molecular subtype, treatment indicators, and genomic features if available.\n",
        "- **Missingness handling:** Imputation documented in docs/methods.md; per-variable notes in outputs/data_quality/missingness.md.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reproducible workflow\n",
        "- **Environment:** Google Colab + pinned Python package versions\n",
        "- **Pipeline:** Numbered notebook sections (00–99) for setup, EDA, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and reporting\n",
        "- **Outputs:** All figures/tables saved under outputs/ with traceable file stems and code cell references\n",
        "- **Versioning:** GitHub + commit messages describing changes to data processing and modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "## Deliverables\n",
        "- **EDA figures:** Histograms, correlation heatmaps, Kaplan–Meier curves\n",
        "- **Model artifacts:** Trained Cox PH / RSF models + serialized coefficients/feature importances\n",
        "- **Reports:** Markdown summaries under docs/; per-run metrics under outputs/metrics/\n",
        "- **Interpretability:** Coefficient tables, partial dependence/ICE, SHAP for survival models where applicable\n",
        "\n",
        "## Directory map\n",
        "- **docs/** Project overview, clinical and statistical methodology, references\n",
        "- **notebooks/** Numbered Colab notebooks with step-by-step sections\n",
        "- **outputs/** Saved plots, tables, metrics, and logs with run IDs\n",
        "- **data/** METABRIC_cleaned_imputed.csv (never committed if restricted)\n",
        "- **src/** Reusable functions for preprocessing, modeling, and reporting\n",
        "\n",
        "## Governance and collaboration\n",
        "- **Provenance tracking:** Each output records dataset hash, git commit, and code cell ID\n",
        "- **Clinical review loop:** Analysts prepare interpretable summaries; clinicians review figures/tables; feedback integrated into subsequent runs\n",
        "- **Ethics:** Non-identifiable, secondary analysis; methods emphasize transparency and limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "## Quick start\n",
        "1. **Open Colab:** notebooks/00_setup_environment.ipynb\n",
        "2. **Load data:** data/METABRIC_cleaned_imputed.csv\n",
        "3. **Run EDA:** notebooks/10_eda_profile.ipynb (outputs/data_profile/*)\n",
        "4. **Preprocess + encode:** notebooks/20_preprocess_encode.ipynb (outputs/preprocessing/*)\n",
        "5. **Train survival models:** notebooks/30_modeling_survival.ipynb (outputs/models/*, outputs/metrics/*)\n",
        "6. **Generate report:** notebooks/90_reporting.ipynb writes docs/* from outputs/*\n",
