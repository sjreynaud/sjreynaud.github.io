        "**Step #12** performs a set of essential data‑quality checks to confirm that the dataset is clean, complete, and structurally sound after all preprocessing steps. It examines the remaining missing values, reviews summary statistics for numeric variables, and verifies the final shape of the DataFrame. These checks provide a quick diagnostic snapshot of the dataset, ensuring that imputation, feature engineering, and scaling were applied correctly and that the dataset is ready for modeling.\n",

Confirming that no missing values remain, that numeric variables are properly scaled, and that the dataset has the expected dimensions ensures that the pipeline is stable, reproducible, and trustworthy. This step acts as a safeguard before committing to modeling, preventing costly downstream errors."
